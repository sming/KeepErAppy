Keep Er Appy Andoid App
-------------------------------------- 
This is basically a technology demo for my ability to pick up new technologies. I studied Android for 6 months in my spare time before building this app.

Keep the love of your life happy - help is at hand!
- You're happy when your "better half" is happy, right? This app makes sending short, "thoughtful" emails easy after brief setup steps.
- Select "Compose", then choose your subject line, greeting and sign-off. These are then popped into a new email, just waiting to make your loved one smile.
- Sent emails are added to the "Recents" list, which can be used for even faster happiness-generation.
- Place a shortcut on the Home screen which opens a pre-populated email, ready for sending
- Need a gentle reminder to send thoughtful messages? No worries: set the earliest and latest times (e.g. 2pm and 5pm) and you'll be notified some time between 2 and 5pm. The exact reminder time changes every day, giving the appearance that it's you and not Keep Er Appy that's remembering to send the messages :)
- "Keep warm!" and "Stay cool!" suggestions when the weather gets crazy
